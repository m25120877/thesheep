    No one has done this before.
<br>

<br>
    I thought that is what art should be.<br>
 
Is it difficult to show art? Yes it is. <br>
Zoo without animals, spikes growing up from a wall in public space
Do you trust the authorities?    <br>
    </P>



<P style="color:deepskyblue;"><b>You can see some of my sheep’s, they are wondering in the campus like a lingering ghost, waiting for someone. You can talk to them, or I should say, they are waiting for someone to talk to them.  they are at the wall where has spikes on 4 o'clock to five and DIS on 3:45 today.One will be at the wall tomorrow noon too.</b></P>
